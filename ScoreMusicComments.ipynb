You did a great job putting all this different types of voices together, some parts got a Rude Boy feeling but you can sing as well. The autotune really matches your voice. The only part that I think you can Improve is the lyrics. I don't know if English is your fist language but looks like you tryed your best but sometimes you can say the same thing you wanna say but with other words to make the song sound better. Try to connect with some song writers to help you make an even better song. If your listeners speak more french than english, try to do some songs in french too. Really good work man, congrats\",\n",

              " 'Hi\\xa0 MADSUN :)\\n\\nMy name is Paige, from GNH Records. Thank you so much for submitting Discovery to us to consider for our Apple Music + Spotify playlist, Futurepop. It\\'s our home for\\xa0 \"cutting-edge pop acts who nimbly genre-blend with clever, subversive sound design, ultramodern hip-hop or pioneering alternative R&B.\" Here are the links to follow / share it:\\n- Spotify: urlgeni.us/spotify/NgzB\\xa0\\n- Apple Music: urlgeni.us/applemusic/7jUt\\xa0\\n\\nI realise it\\'s a valuable use of credits to do this here, so we\\'ve taken a very close listen to Discovery and want to provide you this constructive feedback on your submission.\\n\\xa0\\nThere\\'s heaps we love about this track. Sound design is top notch; the little stereo-ping-ponged bells in the breakdown. The tasteful sub bass underscoring the pads. The vibrant percussion keeping the groove throughout the builds. The emotive strings, and the mid-tempo heavily sidechained kick-snare beat of the \"drop\". The dancing octave strings.\\n\\nUltimately, while it impressed us, unfortunately the main thing this missed to be a Futurepop track was enough vocal. It was quite minimal on lyrics, with no verse/chorus vocal to hold it to the pop category. As such, it\\'s more of an electronic track, not a pop track and therefore not an appropriate match. For Futurepop, we\\'re consciously trying to be a real point of difference, looking for singles that push themselves into a bolder niche, taking innovative risks with more synthetic sound design or atypical arrangements, while still being grounded by very strong pop fundamentals. When you play through the first few artists we\\'ve selected for the playlist, you\\'ll hear what we mean. We try to elevate the playlist beyond systemic commercial R&B/pop. I think you will easily find some major success with playlists and blogs that do focus on electronic music more broadly, though.\\n\\nOne other thing I can offer you, is a bit of an industry connection. One of our managed artists is Spectoral (@spectoral on Instagram) who co-curates the playlist with us. In fact, it lives on his artist account. So while I can\\'t offer you a placement on the playlist, if you\\'re an artist who is interested in creating music for the bleeding-edge, an artist who is a music addict like us, who shares our tastes, and always aspires to keep tabs on the most current sounds, then I\\'d strongly encourage you to DM @spectoral - on Instagram. Introduce yourself to him and send him your link. Tell him you spoke to Paige on Groover. He\\'s real nice, a well connected producer and curator from Australia who is a true passionate new music addict himself. He\\'s also a committee member of a not-for-profit (free) organisation called Beat Collective (beatcollective.net) that is one of the biggest artist-producer communities in the world. So he meets a LOT of artists and it\\'s very valuable to be connected. So even if that doesn\\'t result in you getting added to a playlist, you should still get some good value out of at least talking to him, a like-minded artist who values building good industry connections.\\n\\nGo for it! :)\\n\\nPaige R\\nGNH',\n",

A thing I don't like too much are the changes in the drum patterns, and the drum sounds themselves. I would dare with more modern sounds: even if this takes a lot from the tradition I would experimentate a bit with the sounds. Everyone is doing that at the moment, even in the World music genre. I would change the piano sound as well, but that's personal taste. Let it trigger! Maybe the track needs a better chorus, but this is another sleeve.\\n\\nThanks a lot! Great effort!

When the first notes of the acoustic guitar sounded, I thought it would take a different direction — and I was pleasantly surprised with how it went, especially when the drums arrived. It\\'s worth mentioning that the percussion here made all the difference, as it did a good job holding everything together and bringing some fast-paced rhythm to a subtle song, in a coherent way.\\n\\nSome of the genres you brought on the description are pretty apparent, but some others might not be that much, and that\\'s actually a good thing in my opinion. Personally, I enjoy it very much when the listener gradually starts discovering some references as I listen to the track. For example, there is definitely a rock vibe in the mood of the song, and there is one moment where it becomes most clear. At 1:48 minute, when there is only the acoustic guitar and subsequently the vocals, is a really good example of some formats used on some very famous rock hits. And, this one specifically reminded me so much of the song \"Drive\" from Incubus. Not to compare here, but not think of them was almost impossible.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s a really enjoyable song that many people with different music tastes might enjoy. It\\'s well-produced, well equalized and the volumes of the instrument seem well balanced as well. We are adding this to our playlist on Spotify! Cheers from Brazil and keep going!\\n',\n",
